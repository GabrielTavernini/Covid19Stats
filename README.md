# Covid19Stats
It's a simple app to visualize charts and statistics about the current Covid-19 emergency. <br>
It's developed using Flutter and some plugins such as [LiquidPullToRefresh](https://github.com/aagarwal1012/Liquid-Pull-To-Refresh) and [FlCharts](https://github.com/imaNNeoFighT/fl_chart)<br>
All the data visualized in the app is taken from the website [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) 📈<br><br>
